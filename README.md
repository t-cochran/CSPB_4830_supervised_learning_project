# Predicting wine quality with supervised learning algorithms
*CSPB 4830 Machine Learning - Summer 2022*

* Author: Thomas Cochran

__Project Description__

* The goal of this project is to classify wine quality using physiochemical properties, e.g. pH, sulphates, sugar, and alcohol content.

* Different supervised learning algorithms will be trained to accomplish this task. Their performance will be compared and evaluated.

__Problem Type__

* This is an multiclass classification problem. The target class `quality` is an ordinal variable that ranks wine quality on a scale from $[0, 10]$.

__Project Motivation__

* Data driven approaches can assist wine producers to quickly and objectively assess wine quality at various stages of production.

* Identifying features most critical to wine quality can assist commercial producers in optimizing growing conditions and harvest.

* Consumers can make more informed decisions by recognizing features associated with higher quality wines.
